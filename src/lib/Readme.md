# Lib

This folder contains components, styles and utility classes that can be copy-pasted into any other project.
Files may be used in shared or contexts.
All components have a basic styling, but should be further styled in your project CI.
This lib components and css require Tailwind CSS, but don't reference any specific colors.
However, it is expected that you have a grayscale color scheme in your tailwind config.
